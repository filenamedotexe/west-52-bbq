        From Marines to Meats
      </h3>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Troy Johnson's journey to becoming one of Illinois' most respected pit masters began in the United States Marine Corps.
        Serving as a cook (MOS 3381) from 1983 to 1989, Troy learned the value of precision, consistency, and never compromising on quality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        After his service, Troy applied those same military standards to his true passion: BBQ. Over 50 years of cooking, smoking,
        and catering have turned him into a master craftsman. Every brisket, every rack of ribs, every pound of pulled pork is smoked
        with the same attention to detail he learned in the Marines.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Today, Troy is a proud husband and father who runs West 52 BBQ with his family. His commitment to quality BBQ and treating
        every customer like family has made West 52 BBQ a favorite in Will County and beyond.
