Authentic slow-smoked pulled pork that's been a crowd favorite for decades. Pork shoulder smoked for 10+ hours until it's so tender, you can pull it apart with a fork.

Choose your style:
- **Carolina-Style**: Tangy vinegar-based sauce (medium spicy)
- **Kansas City-Style**: Thick, smoky, slightly sweet sauce (mild)

Served with two sides and cornbread. Perfect on its own or pile it high on a sandwich!

**Why customers love it:**
- Authentic smoking technique
- Two regional sauce options
- Great value
- Gluten-free & dairy-free

A West 52 BBQ classic since day one.
